# fifa-21-data-cleaning-challenge


In this project, I took a FIFA 21 dataset, called fifa21 raw data v2, and cleaned for exploration, analysis and visualization using Python.

All the files that have 1 at the end were the initial cleaning processes and the end file was fifa_clean csv file.

All the files with 2 at the end were the final cleaning processes after realizing some few errors in the fifa_clean csv file and the end result was final_fifa_21_clean csv file.
